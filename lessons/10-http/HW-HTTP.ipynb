    "# Homework: Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Stories By Title\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you're tasked with performing a sentiment analysis on Reddit story titles within a sub-reddit. The goal is to provide a overall \"gist\" as to whether that subreddit is a positive or negative one. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with Reddit, here are some API urls to a few sub-reddits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `worldnews` URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top.json\n",
    "- `writingprompts` URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/top.json\n",
    "- `todayilearned` URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/top.json\n",
    "- `explainlikeimfive` URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/top.json\n",
    "- `politics` URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/top.json\n",
    "\n",
    "From these URLs you should be able to figure out the pattern URL for any given subreddit name such as `news`, or `ama`. Somewhere within the bowles of the API output, you can see the title of each story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use IPython interact to provide a list of subreddits to choose from (a list will be provided, but you are free to add your own). When an item from the list is selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Reddit API to get the titles of the top 25 stories in that subreddit\n",
    "- Combine the titles from all 25 stories into a single paragraph of text\n",
    "- Pass the text to the sentiment analysis API we used in the lab. It is important to send all titles to the sentiment analysis with a single request. If you don't the serive will lock us out.\n",
    "- Print the overall sentiment, each probability (pos, neg, neutral) and the title of each story in the subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS and ADVICE: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a bottom up approach; work on the pieces, then assemble them.\n",
    "- Start with sentiment. \n",
    "    - Get that working as a function similar to the lab. You can copy the code from the lab.\n",
    "    - Make sure you can output the overall sentiment, and probababilities for positive, negative and neutral\n",
    "- Next work on fetching the Reddit story titles from the API\n",
    "  - The Reddit api requires you to use a unique `User-Agent` key in the headers of the `get()` request. The value of this key should be `ist256.lesson10.homework:v1.0 (by /u/netid)` where `netid` is your netid, of course.\n",
    "  - Make sure to put a `limit` key on the query string with a value of `25`\n",
    "  - Pick a single subreddit like `https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top.json` and work with that until you can figure out how to fetch the stories.\n",
    "  - Once you've got the stories, figure out how to just get the titles form the stories.\n",
    "  - With everything working, refactor into a function which inputs a subreddit name and outputs the story titles as a list.\n",
    "- Once you have the story titles and sentiment, its time build the main program\n",
    "    - DO NOT get sentiment for each title. If you do this the sentiment API will block us. Instead combine all the titles into a single paragraph with `S.join()` \n",
    "    - Once it all works, feel free to add your own subreddits to the list!\n",
