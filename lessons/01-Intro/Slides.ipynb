    "2. **Large group**. Reinforce what you learned through your reading. You observe these topics within the Jupyterhub context. It is best to take notes and ask questions. No writing code at this point. \n",
    "3. **Lab**. Your first foray into writing code, you are eased into it. There is reading code and writing code, and walk-through video should you need it. This is participation graded. L01-L13\n",
    "4. **Small Group - Second Lecture**. This is your first foray into problem solving with code. It's done in a group setting. Participation is graded. S01-S13\n",
    "5. **Homework**. This is an opportunity to demonstrate you can problem-solve a code solution on your own with minimal assistance. There are advice videos, and of course support. This is graded. H01-H13\n",
    "6. **Metacognition** You will be asked to think about what you have learned and express your learning journey as part of turning in your work. What you have learned from the work is more important than the work itself. "
